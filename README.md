## Overview

OnTrack is an open-source desktop application for tracking nutrition and fitness routines. It was written in Python 2.7.11. Its user interface was built with the PyQt4 bindings for Qt v4 under a GPLv3 license. The OnTrack application folder (containing the application and all dependencies), as well as the OnTrack Installer executable, were created with PyInstaller. OnTrack is tested for the Windows OS and is not yet available for macOS or Linux.

## Installation

You can download the OnTrack installer by clicking the link below.

The installer contains the zipped OnTrack application folder. To "install" OnTrack, it simply unzips this folder into your selected directory and creates a desktop shortcut to the app's executable file 'OnT.exe'. The installer size is 60 MB. The OnTrack app initially requres 100 MB of free space. Each OnTrack user typically generates between 5-10 MB of additional data. Your antivirus software might flag the installer since it is an unknown executable file without a digital signature.

## Using OnTrack

On the Home page, you will find the Main Menu at the top, a Login Menu at the center, and a Settings button beneath the Login Menu.
